<p>Facebook Interactions is a software-based study of patterns of interactions between people's use of Facebook and the online advertising they receive. Through this study we aim to map and understand how something that may have personal value for people who use Facebook is transformed into economic value for Facebook and their commercial clients. A fully-anonymized version of the data produced by the study will be made publicly available as support material for the project's analyses and to inform future research on these issues. A description of what this public data set will contain, and how it will be anonymized is given in the <a href="#privacy">Data Collection and Privacy Policy</a> section below.</p>

<p>We have developed a Firefox browser Add-on, called Admonitor, and Facebook App to gather data from participant's online activity as part of the study. The software will create visualisations of this activity that will cast new light on participants' use and experience of online social media, allowing participants to understand more of the processes that happen behind the screen on Facebook and reveal the relations between Facebook and online advertising.</p>

<img src="{% static 'img/analysispage_sm.png' %}">

<p>The Facebook App will collate information from participants' use of Facebook, this will be used to chart the interactions between the participant and their Facebook friends, to determine what kinds of postings receive the most attention, and gather information related to advertising that appears in the postings. All data collected through the software will be strictly confidential, and only available to the individual participant and the research team. Information gathered from Facebook will be anonymized as far as possible when viewed by the researchers. Please see the information on the <a href="#facebookapp">Facebook App</a> below for more details.</p>

<p>The Admonitor Add-on will monitor the advertising that participants are presented with on Facebook and as they browse the web. This will be compared against participants' own Facebook activity to see how much the advertising reflects and feeds into that. The data collected, and how this will be displayed, is described in more detail in the <a href="#admonitor">Admonitor</a> section below.</p>

<p>Participants will be able to view the data collected by the Facebook App and Admonitor Add-on on this website through a private personal account that is set up when you register with the project. The data will be displayed in a visual graph showing the flows of interactions between users on Facebook posts that participants have either created or responded to (through liking, commenting or sharing). This is displayed against a visualisation of the advertising data collected by Admonitor.</p>

<img src="{% static 'img/graph_labeled.png' %}">

<p>More detailed information can be seen by clicking on specific elements in the graph, showing individual posts, Facebook ads, or a graph of advertising activity identifying advertising companies and the sites where they are targetting people.</p>

<img src="{% static 'img/detail_comp.png' %}">

<p>We aim to collect data for a period of 2 to 3 months from each participant. At the end of the data collection phase we will produce a new set of visualisations that display some of the patterns that have been detected in the study and show anonymized comparisons between different groups of participants.</p>

<h2>Facebook App</h2>

<div class="text-center">
<p>The Values &amp; Value Facebook App collates information from participant's use of Facebook. The app is automatically installed on your Facebook account when you first <a href="{% url 'login' %}">login</a> as a participant to the project. No further actions are required.</p>

<p>The data gathered by the app is used to generate the interaction flows within the visualisation that can be viewed in your personal <a href="{% url 'participant_data' %}">analysis page</a>.</p>

<p>The visualisations and graphs are only available to users registered with the Values & Value website. Users only have access to their own data and are not able to see others. Content from posts is included so that you can relate the graph back to the original messages and, if appropriate, so that specific posts can be discussed in more detail during face-to-face and follow-up interviews that we conduct with participants.</p> 

<p>The researchers are able to see the data for all participants but only in an anonymized form. Users's real names are replaced with random fictitious names and no content from Facebook posts, such as messages, or photos, are shown to researchers. The researchers are therefore able to see the patterns of interaction between users but without knowing who is who or what the content of this is.</p>

<p>At the end of the project, all personal data such as names and the content of Facebook postings will be erased and only the anonymized version of the data will be retained. Please see our <a href="#privacy">privacy policy</a> for full details.</p>

<p>The app requires the user to agree to several access permissions on their Facebook account. These are listed below with an explanation of what data is collated in relation to that.</p>

<h2>Admonitor</h2>

<div class="text-center">
<p>Admonitor is an Add-on for Firefox browsers that has been specially written for the Values &amp; Value project. It works alongside the <a href="#facebookapp">Facebook App</a> and gathers data that we are not able to collect directly from Facebook itself, this includes advertising shown on Facebook, the order of posts as they appear at the top of users' Facebook timelines, and advertising included on other sites via systems such as GoogleAds. We are gathering this data in order to relate patterns of user interaction with Facebook to possible patterns that might appear in the advertising users see as they browse the web, so that we can learn more about how Facebook seeks to stimulate user interaction in order to increase the economic value that can be generated from this.</p>

<p>The software collects advertising data from Facebook that appears as Sponsored Stories in your main activity stream, the adverts that appear in the Facebook sidebar and ambient advertising that is pushed to you as you browse the web. We are gathering these to determine if there are any patterns relating user activity on Facebook to advertising content and if common patterns in advertising can be identified amongst users who are friends. Where possible we will retrieve a copy of any images used in this advertising, in order to help identify where advertising content may relate back to user content. This is particularly necessary with the web advertising as often such ads consist only of an image and no other identifying content. These images will be deleted at the end of the project.</p>

<p>The software also collects the order of posts as they appear in your Facebook activity stream. We are gathering these to determine if there are patterns in how Facebook selects the posts that it displays to you and, as with adverts, if common patterns can be identified amongst users who are friends.</p>

<p>The detailed content of this data is only available to users registered with the Values & Value website. Users only have access to their own data and are not able to see others.</p> 

<p>The Admonitor Add-on is easy to install and requires no input or actions from the user after it has been registered. Full details on installing and using the Add-on are available to participants at the <a href="{% url 'setup_apikey' %}">Admonitor setup page</a>.</p>

<a name="privacy"></a>
<h2>Data Collection and Privacy Policy</h2>

<div class="text-center">

<p>All participants are requested to provide consent before any data is collected. The terms of consent are as follows:</p>

<div class="text-left">
<ol class="vavs-consent">
<li>I consent to be included in the project.</li>
<li>I confirm that the study has been explained to me and that I have had the opportunity to ask questions. Please contact either Simon Yuill or Beverley Skeggs if you have any questions/queries. You can reach them through our <a href="/contact/">contact</a> page.</li>
<li>I understand that my participation is voluntary and that I am free to withdraw at any time, without giving any reason.</li>
<li>I understand that the information I give in the interview will be confidential unless it is impossible to do so (via social media) and that I will remain anonymous where possible. If I prefer a pseudonym I will provide one.</li>
<li>I understand that confidentiality will be breached if I reveal matters that I later request to be withdrawn.</li>
<li>I agree that my interview(s) may be used by the researchers for the purposes of the research report, publications associated with the project, and the dissemination of research findings.</li>
<li>I agree for any interviews I give to be recorded if necessary.</li>
<li>I give my permission for the transcripts of the interviews to be stored by the research council database and understand that transcripts will not have my name attached, and all identifying material (such as names) will be changed or deleted.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>The visualisations and graphs are only available to users registered with the Values &amp; Value website. Users only have access to their own data and are not able to see others.</p> 

<p>The researchers are able to see the data for all participants but only in an anonymized form. Users' real names are replaced with random fictitious names and no content from Facebook posts, such as messages, comments, or photos, are shown to researchers. The researchers are therefore able to see the patterns of interaction between users but without knowing who is who or what the content of this is.</p>

<p>The images and content from Sponsored Stories and advertising on Facebook is visible to researchers as this does not contain any personal information originating from participants themselves.</p>

<p>The web advertising data includes the URLS of the adverts and the domain name of the site that it was displayed on, but does not collect the specific URL of the page itself. For example, if the software detects an advert from GoogleAds on a page with a URL such as <em>http://www.example.com/pages/content.html</em> it will only store the domain name for the page, i.e.: <em>http://www.example.com</em> Any images collected from web advertising will be deleted at the end of the project.

<p>When viewing the web advertising data the researchers are able to see the names of the advertising companies but not the actual websites visited by participants, these are given anonymized ID numbers instead.</p>

<p>It may be that during the study the researchers need to see some of the content from your Facebook activity, for example to discuss a specific posting or series of events that are relevant to the study. In this case the researchers will either meet with you in person, if doing an interview, or request that you turn off the anonymization for your data. This is controlled by a setting in your personal profile which only you have access to.</p>

<p>At the end of the project, all personal data such as names and the content of Facebook postings will be erased and only the anonymized version of the data will be retained.</p>

<p>The data that will be made available in the public data set at the end of the research will contain the following:</p>

<div class="text-left">
<ul class="vavs-consent">
<li>A list of anonymized users in the form of a randomy generated fictitious name and an ID number that is unique to this project.</li>
<li>A list of anonymized Facebook posts in the form of an ID number for each post that is unique to this project, the original date of the post, the type of post (ie status, photo, video, etc), a list of anonymized users who have interacted with it, the number of likes it received, the dates and anonymized user IDs of comments (but not the actual comments themselves), and the number of external URLs listed in the post (but not the actual URLs).</li>
<li>A list of anonymized Facebook Sponsored Stories in the form of an ID number for each story that is unique to this project, the original date of the story, and an ID for each anonymized user who received it.</li>
<li>A list of anonymized Facebook ads in the form of an ID number for each advert that is unique to this project, the original date of the advert, and an ID for each anonymized user who received it.</li>
<li>A list of anonymized web advertising data in the form of an ID number for each advert that is unique to this project, the original date of the advert, and an ID for each anonymized user who received it, the domain name of the advertiser, and an anonymized identifier for the domain name where it was shown.</li>
<li>Sets of data showing patterns and statistics relating to the anonymized data described above.</li>
<li>Anonymized versions of the input received in the <a href="{% url 'survey' 1 %}">Facebook Survey</a> and <a href="{% url 'current_comments' %}">Facebook Comment</a> questionnaires.</li>
<li>Where appropriate, quotations from participants given through interview with the consent and appropriate anonymization as agreed between the researchers and participant.</li>
<li>All other data collected during the project will be permanantly erased, unless otherwise agreed between the researchers and the relevant participants.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>If any changes are made to this during the project we will update the listing here and contact all participants to notify them of this and re-confirm their consent.</p>

<p>You also have the right to withdraw from the project at any time and have all of your data completely removed. If you wish to do this, please contact the research team from the <a href="/contact/" target="_blank">contact page</a> or by email.</p>
