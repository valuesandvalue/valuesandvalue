    <p>I worked at the Worcester College of Higher Education and the Universities of Keele, York, Lancaster and Manchester before joining the Department of Sociology at Goldsmiths. I’ve worked in the areas of Women’s Studies and Cultural Studies as well as Sociology.
My research interests consolidate around the issue of value and values. How do we know what value and values are? What do they do? What do they make us do?  My interest began in a study of respectability, which was based on a longitudinal ethnography with white working class women in North West England, published as <A href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BNS3FMBdRFIC&source=gbs_similarbooks" target="_blank">Formations of Class and Gender: Becoming Respectable</a>. </p>I explored how their subjectivity was produced through a defence of their value/s against symbolic devaluation. The performance of respectability enabled them to display their value against those who judged. This study enabled me to hinge class to gender formation and explore the role of symbolic value through media and cultural formations. I used feminist and poststructuralist theory, Pierre Bourdieu (see <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-954X.2005.00521.x/abstract" target="_blank">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-954X.2005.00521.x/abstract</a>) and to the economic abstractions of Marx, to help me understand. I’m still working on this topic (it is my life’s work), currently attempting to understand how value moves on, through and with people as they live the imperatives of exchange in capitalism.</p>
<p>During the period of this research I published a textbook on the media which drew on the cultural studies traditions of the time. I didn’t realise how significant this analysis would be to building my future work as it enabled me to understand how all analysis needs to understand representations, visibility and recognition. Claiming recognition through visibility in the form of identity would not work for the women of my ethnography for instance as symbolic visibility is always value loaded and the category ‘working class women’ contains negative evaluations. The media has consistently and repeatedly (from art history, TV, to new digital media) represented working class women with negative value. This process has intensified more recently through the figure of the ‘Chav’. This is why I argued that identity politics does not work for working class women who are always made abject. They cannot make a claim on the state when their only entry into the public is to be coded as the constitutive limit to the proper (eg see <a href="http://eprints.gold.ac.uk/4456/1/Class%2C_Culture_and_Morality_-_Legacies_and_Logics_in_the_Space_of_Identification_-_chap_17.pdf">http://eprints.gold.ac.uk/4456/1/Class%2C_Culture_and_Morality_-_Legacies_and_Logics_in_the_Space_of_Identification_-_chap_17.pdf</a>).</p>
<p>During this period I also edited a book on methodology – on feminist cultural theory. I’ve always loved methodological debates and have continued to be fascinated to how techniques produce our knowledge. All my interests were then lived through two ESRC research projects: the first on <a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Sexuality_and_the_Politics_of_Violence_a.html?id=dTCha4CQveoC&redir_esc=y" target="_blank">Sexuality and the Politics of Violence</a> (with Les Moran, Paul Tyrer and Karen Corteen) which was a multi-method study of the difference actual gay space makes to the generation of safety from violence. Comparing gay space Manchester with negligible gay space Lancaster and working with a great research team we used socio-legal theory to investigate how propriety links to property, visibility to recognition and values to value. The second project was on the moral economy of reality television, published as <a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tJObyMAhtv8C&pg=PA158&lpg=PA158&dq=reacting+to+reality+TV+skeggs&source=bl&ots=phViW91Yqz&sig=5wY3FEq2DDhr88-3jQXdAdvxdAM&hl=en&sa=X&ei=wR6WUoHWA4fxhQeQ9oGADg&ved=0CIEBEOgBMAk#v=onepage&q=reacting%20to%20reality%20TV%20skeggs&f=false" target="_blank">Reacting to Reality TV</a> (with Helen Wood) where we explored audience reactions. Interestingly issues of respectability and defence of value were central to the women’s responses. We also devised a new method’ the affective textual encounter’ to understand how television engages viewers through the use of sensation. And in the book we mount a challenge to theories of governmentality that assume that we are all neo-liberal subjects. This challenge continues through this project which asks: What matters to people? How do they formulate value/s beyond economic perceptions? I have been developing the idea of ‘person value’ through ‘value struggles’ to understand how different forms of de/valued personhood are lived and ill turn to two different mediums – institutional faith and virtual friendships – to explore these issues I’ve been developing in more detail.</p>

    <p>I am an artist, writer and programmer and produce work that includes the use of interview and research processes, film, publishing, and custom software systems. I was the inaugural winner of the Vilém Flusser Theory Award (Berlin, 2008), have been a Research Resident at the Piet Zwart Institute (Rotterdam, 2005), Institute for Advanced Studies Visiting Fellow at the University of Warwick (2013), and Honorary Visiting Research Fellow with the Centre for Cultural Studies at Goldsmiths College (London, 2011-2014).</p>
    <p>My previous projects have included <i><a target="_blank" href="http://www.spring-alpha.org">spring_alpha</a></i>, a project that combined practices from Free Software practice, live-coding, and the Exploded School system proposed by Colin Ward, as a means of participatory analysis of urban social space via gaming and software, and <i><a target="_blank" href="http://www.stackwalker.org">Stackwalker</a></i>, a collection of interviews recorded in the Hebrides and the North East of Scotland, with others in Edinburgh, Glasgow, and London. This material was initiated from an enquiry into current forms of self-organised production in rural Scotland, the relationship of these to law and nature, and the various localised, often informal, forms of governance and social structure within which these exist.</p>
