<p>For our research on modern digital relations we are looking for input and 
participation from people using Facebook.</p>

<p>There are two ways of being involved, as part of the detailed study, or 
by sending us your 
<a href="{% url 'current_comments' %}">comments on Facebook</a>.</p>

<p>For the detailed study, we would like to follow your online Facebook 
activity and the advertising that appears as you browse 
the web, and interview you about your experiences with Facebook. This will take 
place over a period of three months and to take part we will ask you to install 
two pieces of software we have created for the project. You can read about 
these on the <a href="{% url 'interactions_study' %}">software page</a>. All information 
that we gather will be kept anonymous and you will have full private access to 
this.</p>

<p>To take part in the detailed study, or to find our more, please send us your 
contact details using this form:</p>

<p>We are also gathering poepleâ€™s
<a href="{% url 'current_comments' %}">comments on Facebook</a> which will 
help inform the questions we will be asking as the research develops. You can 
read and contribute to this on the 
<a href="{% url 'current_comments' %}">Facebook Comments</a> page.</p>
